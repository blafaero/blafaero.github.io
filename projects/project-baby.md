# Our First Newborn

In November of this year, my wife and I were blessed with a beautiful new baby girl, Eden. We had been praying for years for a child of our own and are so thankful our prayers were answered!

Since she was born, we have been working (unsuccessfully) towards settling into a new routine. Unfortunately, we have yet to find it! We have had many sleepless nights since she was born, and our available time to get stuff done on the farm has vanished, but we would not trade it for anything!
